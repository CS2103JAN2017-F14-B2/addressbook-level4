The other task will remain in KIT. Instructions on these commands can be found in the respective section of the commands.

**Q**: Can I manually edit the storage file?  <br>
**A**: Yes, you can. It is a xml file called kit.xml. It can be found under data\kit.xml by default. Be careful in making changes to it if you are unfamiliar with XML, the program might not start properly if the file’s format is invalid.
